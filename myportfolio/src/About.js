            <h5>Journey</h5>
            <p>
                Years of experience in wellness, customer service, and management have instilled in me a passion for making lives better. 
                I love human connection, I'm a feeler, and visual-thinker. I'm driven by empathy and believe if you approach every 
                project with the user experience in mind, the rest will fall into place. 
                <br/>
                <br/> In the fast pace society we live in, it was important to me to keep up with growing technology and I 
                took the plunge dedicating 600+ hours pursuing General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program. 
                I've learned the foundations of web development, I've built fullstack web apps, but more importantly I've 
                learned a programmatic approach to problem solving. 
            </p>
            <h5>Personal Interests</h5>
            <p>
                When I'm not working on a project or sharpening my programming skills, I enjoy teaching community yoga classes, laughing at 
                good puns, and adventuring outdoors. 
            </p>
            <h5>Goals</h5>
            <p>
                I'm currently seeking employment in a position that leverages my combined project management and software engineering skills. 
                I want to join an organization that values collaboration, a growth mindset, and making lives better.  My goal in the 
                future is to contribute my skills to greater social good.
